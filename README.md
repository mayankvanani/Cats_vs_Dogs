# Cats_vs_Dogs

## Summary
Dataset contains 4000 images of cats and dogs in training set and 1000 images of cat and dogs in test set. Here **Convolutional Neural Net** is used for building model which predicts whether the image is of cat or dog.

The model is in the raw form and is not a end-to-end solution. User needs to build pipeline to use it in real time.
